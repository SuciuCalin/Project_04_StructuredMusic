# Musical Structure App

<h2>Project Overview:</h2>

This project is a chance for you to combine and practice everything you learned in this section of the Nanodegree program. You will be making the structure of a music app using intents and empty activities.

The goal is to design and create <b>the structure of a Music app</b> which would allow a user to play audio files. There are many music player apps, and they make a wide variety of design choices. It will be your job to decide what kind of music app your structure would turn into and build out that structure using intents. Will you build an app to play music from the user’s library of music? Will you build an app to stream random songs from a database? Will you build a musical suggestion engine? Those choices are up to you!

<b>Project Goals</b>

You won't need to implement the actual music playing functionality. You just need to describe it. The goal of this project is to plain for building an app that has the structure of a music playing app to practice app design and the use of explicit intents to navigate around the app.

Each Activity should contain a TextView that describes the Activity. If you decide to mock up the content, or add real content, the reviewer might comment on your work, but it will not be considered to meet the requirements.

<h3>Requirements</h3>

<ul>
<li><b>The app’s structure is suitable for a music player app. A similarly structured app which focuses on audiobooks, podcasts, or other audio media is also acceptable.</b></li>
<br>
<li><b>Each activity is clearly labelled, using a TextView, such that the final purpose of such an activity is easy to understand.
<br>For instance, one screen might be labelled ‘song detail screen’ and another might be labelled ‘music library’</li></b>
<br>
<li><b>Any other Activity that requires an external library or class not yet covered also includes the name of that library or class.</b></li>
<br>
<li><b>The app contains 3 to 6 activities.</b></li>
<br>
<li><b>The app contains multiple activities, each labelled, which together make a cohesive music app.</li></b>
<br>
<li><b>Each activity contains a TextView which explains the purpose of the activity.</li></b>
<br>
<li><b>Each activity contains buttons which link it to other activities a user should be able to reach from that activity. For instance, a ‘library’ activity might contain a button to move to the ‘now playing’ activity.</li></b>
<br>
<li><b>The code adheres to all of the following best practices:</b>
  <ul><li>Text sizes are defined in sp</li>
  <li>Lengths are defined in dp</li>
  <li>Padding and margin is used appropriately, such that the views are not crammed up against each other.</li>
</ul></li>
<br>
<li><b>The code runs without errors</li></b>
<br>
<li><b>Each button’s behavior is determined by an OnClickListener in the Java code rather than by the android:onClick attribute in the XML Layout.</li></b>
<br>
<li><b>Each button properly opens the intended activity using an explicit Intent.</li></b>
<br>
<li><b>The code is properly formatted i.e. there are no unnecessary blank lines; there are no unused variables or methods; there is no commented out code.
<br>The code also has proper indentation when defining variables and methods.</li></b>
<br>
<li><b>Code is easily readable such that a fellow programmer can understand the purpose of the app.</li></b>
<br>
<li><b>All variables, methods, and resource IDs are descriptively named such that another developer reading the code can easily understand their function.</li></b>
<br>
</ul>
